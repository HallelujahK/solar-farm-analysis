### Solar Farm Data Challenge
***Project Overview***
This repository contains the code and documentation for the solar farm data challenge, focusing on understanding, exploring, and analyzing solar farm data from Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo. The challenge is part of the evaluation for a 12-week training program in Data Engineering (DE), Financial Analytics (FA), and Machine Learning Engineering (MLE).

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solar-farm-data-challenge.git
cd solar-farm-analysis

2. Set Up the Virtual Environment
python -m venv env
On Windows use `.\venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Project
*Data Analysis Notebook*: Open and EDA.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
*Scripts*: Execute scripts in the scripts/ directory to perform specific data processing tasks.


## Usage Instructions
*Data Analysis*: Review the Jupyter notebook data_analysis.ipynb for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations.
*Data Processing*: Use the scripts in the scripts/ directory to preprocess data, generate features, or train models.

## Contributions
***My Contributions***
*Data Cleaning*: Implemented data cleaning and preprocessing steps to handle missing values and outliers.
*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: Conducted exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and insights from the solar farm data.
*Visualization*: Created visualizations to present findings and key metrics from the analysis.

Results
Key Findings: Summarized key insights from the data, including trends in solar energy production and factors affecting performance.
Visualizations: Included charts and graphs to illustrate data trends and model predictions.

**Changelog**
v1.0.0: Initial release with data cleaning, EDA, and basic visualizations.
