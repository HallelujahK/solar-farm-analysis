# Solar-Data-Analysis

This repository contains the code, analysis, and documentation for a week-long challenge focused on understanding, exploring, and analyzing solar farm data from Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo. The challenge is part of the evaluation process for a 12-week training program in Data Engineering (DE), Financial Analytics (FA), and Machine Learning Engineering (MLE).

The objective of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on environmental measurements, derive actionable insights, and develop a strategic recommendation for optimal solar farm locations. The project also includes building a Streamlit dashboard to visualize data insights.

Key components of this repository:

Data Understanding & EDA: Exploratory data analysis to uncover trends and patterns.
Statistical Analysis: Using statistical methods to support data-driven decisions.
Streamlit Dashboard: An interactive dashboard for visualizing key insights.
CI/CD Implementation: Automated testing and deployment setup.
